# Returns System Solution

This document provides instructions for implementing the complete returns solution to fix the 404 error.

## Solution Steps

### 1. Add ReturnRequest Model to Prisma Schema

1. The `prisma/schema.prisma` file has been updated with:
   - New `ReturnRequest` model with all required fields
   - Additional fields on `OrderItem` to track return status

2. Run the following command to apply the schema changes:
   ```bash
   npx prisma db push
   ```

### 2. Run Database Migration Script

1. Run the migration script to ensure database tables and columns are created:
   ```bash
   node prisma/migrations/add_return_request_model.js
   ```

### 3. Update API Client Configuration

1. The `app/utils/apiClient.js` file has been updated to use relative URLs instead of hardcoded port 8000.
2. This ensures that API requests are made to the same host/port that serves the frontend.

### 4. Fix Returns Page API Call

1. The Returns page has been updated to handle errors properly and provide better error messages.
2. It will now correctly display the cause of the 404 error.

## Verifying the Solution

1. Restart your Next.js server to ensure all changes are applied:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Navigate to the Returns & Refunds page in the admin portal.

3. If you still encounter issues, check the browser console for error messages, which should now be more descriptive.

## Troubleshooting

If you still see a 404 error:

1. Check that the API route is correctly registered at `app/api/admin/returns/route.js`
2. Ensure the database tables were created by inspecting your database
3. Verify that the server is running on the same port for both frontend and API routes
4. Check your environment variables for any conflicting settings
