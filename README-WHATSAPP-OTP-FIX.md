# WhatsApp OTP Authentication Fix

## Issue
We encountered a database error during WhatsApp OTP authentication. The error occurred because the code was trying to use fields (`isNewUser`) that didn't exist in the database table. This was happening in the `storeOTP` function in `app/api/whatsapp-otp/send/route.js`.

Error message:
```
Invalid `prisma.whatsAppOTP.create()` invocation:
The column `isNewUser` does not exist in the current database.
```

## Solution

1. Used `npx prisma db pull` to get the current database schema
2. Updated the Prisma schema (`prisma/schema.prisma`) to add the missing fields:
   - `name`: String (nullable)
   - `email`: String (nullable)
   - `isNewUser`: Boolean (default: false)

3. Created a custom SQL migration script (`prisma/migrations/add_whatsapp_otp_fields.sql`) to add the missing columns to the database
4. Created a Node.js script (`scripts/apply-whatsapp-otp-migration.js`) to apply the migration
5. Updated the `storeOTP` function to be more robust against database errors

## How to Apply This Fix

1. Copy the updated files to your environment
2. Run `npm install` to ensure dependencies are installed
3. Run the migration script: `node scripts/apply-whatsapp-otp-migration.js`
4. Restart your Next.js application

## Verification

After applying the fix, the WhatsApp OTP authentication should work without database errors. The system will now be able to store and retrieve OTPs with all the required fields.
