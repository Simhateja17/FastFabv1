# Server Error Handling Improvements

## Problem
Our API endpoints were occasionally returning HTML error pages instead of JSON responses when server errors occurred. This caused frontend components to fail when trying to parse these HTML responses as JSON, leading to cryptic "Unexpected token '<'" errors.

## Solution
We've implemented several layers of error handling to ensure that API endpoints always return proper JSON responses, even when errors occur.

### Backend Changes
1. **Global Error Handling Middleware**
   - Created a new `error.middleware.js` that catches all unhandled errors in Express routes
   - Ensures errors are always returned as JSON objects with proper status codes
   - Prevents Express from returning default HTML error pages

2. **Improved Route-level Error Handling**
   - Updated product routes to use `next(error)` pattern to pass errors to the global middleware
   - Added additional validation checks to prevent common errors
   - Improved logging for better error diagnosis

3. **Database Connection Verification**
   - Created a migration script that verifies the PublicProducts view exists
   - Ensures temporary directories for uploads have proper permissions

### Frontend Changes
1. **NextJS API Error Handling**
   - Created a `withErrorHandler` higher-order function to wrap all Next.js API routes
   - Prevents Next.js from returning HTML error pages when errors occur in API routes
   - Added utilities for standardized error and success responses

2. **Content-Type Detection**
   - Enhanced client-side error handling to detect HTML responses
   - Provides more user-friendly error messages when server errors occur
   - Improved logging for easier debugging

3. **Request Retry Logic**
   - The AuthContext now detects HTML responses and treats them as server errors
   - Improved UI feedback when server errors occur

## How to Use

### For Backend Routes
Use the error middleware pattern:
```javascript
router.get("/your-route", authMiddleware, async (req, res, next) => {
  try {
    // Your route logic here
    
    return res.json({ success: true, data: yourData });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error in your route:", error);
    next(error); // Pass to error middleware instead of handling here
  }
});
```

### For Frontend API Routes
Use the `withErrorHandler` higher-order function:
```javascript
import { withErrorHandler, createSuccessResponse } from '@/app/api/error';

export const GET = withErrorHandler(async (request) => {
  // Your API route logic
  
  return createSuccessResponse({ data: yourData });
});
```

## Testing the Changes
1. Start the backend server
2. Navigate to the Seller Products page
3. If there's an error on the server side, you should now see a proper JSON error response instead of an HTML page

## Benefits
- Improved user experience when errors occur
- Easier debugging with consistent error formats
- Better error visibility in the developer console
- No more cryptic "Unexpected token" errors when parsing responses
